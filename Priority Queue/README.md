Hash Table and Heap design by Jeremiah Pratt
User interface (useHeap.cpp) designed by Carl Sable


heap.cpp implements a binary tree to create a priority queue, relying on a hash table designed earlier in the year to quickly
reference individual elements in the tree.

useHeap.cpp provides a user interface for adding, removing, and changing elements in the heap.
