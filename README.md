Projects

1. Hash table with spell checker - Built a hash table from scratch in C++, used to create spell check program. The program reads in a dictionary file into the hash table, and then checks words from a second file against the dictionary to determine valid words.

2. Priority queue - Built a priority queue using binary heap structure which relies on my hash table implementation. Functionality includes insertion, deletion, minimum deletion, and key-changing.

3. Dijkstra's algorithm - Built a directed graph class that relies on both the priority queue and hash table programs, and implemented Djkstra's algorithm to quickly find the shortest path between any two points.
